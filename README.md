# Let's JavaScript

A quick-and-dirty personal scaffold for throwing together a single
page web app. Given how often the JS landscape changes, this is
like the third one of these I've made.

## How to use

For now, just clone/download this repo, and start hacking away and
adding whatever other libraries you want. 

```bash
# put steps here for how to use this scaffold

npm install
```
